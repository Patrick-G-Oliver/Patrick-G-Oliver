## Hello 👋

I'm a fledgling, full stack web developer setting out on a journey of exploration in a world of technologies both known and soon-to-be discovered. 

  * I'm currently finishing my studies at Lambda School in the Full Stack Web Development track. 
  * I'm working on a personal-project application that allows bread formulae to be scaled with baker's percentage math. 🍞
  * I'm seeking my first employment/internship opportunity in the tech industry. 

We may cross paths on 🔗 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-g-oliver/), and you can contanct me at 📬 <patrickgriffitholiver@gmail.com>.
